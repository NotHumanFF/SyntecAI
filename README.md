NLP techniques can be used to develop sentiment analysis models that can automatically classify text into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on the sentiment conveyed. These models utilize various approaches, such as machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, or rule-based methods, to extract sentiment from textual data.
